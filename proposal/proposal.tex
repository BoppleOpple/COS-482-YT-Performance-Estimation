	For my project, I plan to analyze the performance of popular YouTube Videos
	across the coming few weeks to generate a dataset, which I will perform some
	analysis on using ML (for text and images) and some cursory data visualization
	for statistics such as views, likes, and comments across many categories and
	tags.

	Using the Youtube API, I will collect the 200 most popular videos (both for
	each category and overall) at a set time every day for $\sim$30 days. These data
	(thumbnails, titles, descriptions, interaction counts, etc.) will be stored in
	a PostgreSQL database. Affter this period, I expect to have ~6000 observations
	for each category at which point I will attempt to draw some conclusions. I
	will certainly attempt regression using a CNN trained on the thumbnail data,
	and I will look into NLP systems for the video titles. Because this is a
	historically difficult problem to solve (since video performance is not simply
	a function of title and thumbnail), I don't expect to find very strong
	correlations.
